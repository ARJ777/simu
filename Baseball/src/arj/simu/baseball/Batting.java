/**
 * This class is for organising all the different options used by the batting team
 * #1 the leadoff batter the fastest player with good contact hitting
 * #2 the 2nd batter generally is good a bunting and good controlled hits
 * #3 the 3rd batter is a power hitter with strong hits and can drive runs in
 * #4 the cleanup batter is the strongest power hitter that can be more capable than the 3rd
 * #5 the 5th batter is still apart of the clean-up trio similar to the third driving in runs that the 3rd & 4th couldn't
 * #6 the 6th batter is either similar to the 5th batter or is there due to being in a defensive position
 * #7 the 7th batter is normally a batter that focuses on defence so not a great hitter
 * #8 the 8th batter is exactly the same as the 7th is normally a good defensive player
 * #9 the 9th batter is normally the worst hitter normally reserved for pitchers because they need to concentrate on pitching
